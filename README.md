## Introduction

Welcome to the Intel Unnati Text Similarity project! This project, developed by Tejas Mankeshwar, is designed to compare and measure the similarity of two text strings. It utilizes Jupyter Notebook as the primary language and is an efficient tool for text analysis and processing.

## Features

- Measures similarity between two text strings
- Provides detailed analysis and comparison of the text
- User-friendly and easy to use
- Can be integrated with other applications
- Supports multiple languages

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub: ```git clone https://github.com/TejasMankeshwar/Intel_Unnati_Text_Similarity.git```
2. Install Jupyter Notebook: Follow the instructions on the [Jupyter Notebook website](https://jupyter.org/install) to install it on your machine.
3. Install the necessary libraries using pip: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage

1. Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the location where the repository was cloned or downloaded.
2. Open the ```main.ipynb``` file.
3. Run the cells by clicking on the "Run" button or using the shortcut Shift + Enter.
4. Input the text strings you want to compare in the designated cells.
5. The notebook will generate a detailed comparison and similarity score between the two text strings.

Example: 

```
Text 1: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
Text 2: "The fast red fox jumps over the sleeping hound"

Result: These two text strings are 50% similar.
```
